Coronavirus are a group of viruses which cause respiratory tract infections in humans. The most recent disease being spread thorugh this group is COVID-19. Other diseases caused by this group includes MERS in 2012 and SARS in early 2000s. 

For the remainder of this article, I am going to refer COVID-19 as the Chinese Virus and explain why it is the right name to use.

Now, w*hy* WHO should have named the current pandemic we are all facing the Chinese Virus. 

Let's look back at another virus outbreak caused by a coronavirus. This was in 2012 and was called MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) by the WHO. 8 years later, the source of the virus has still not been identified. This is what the WHO website says:

> The origins of the virus are not fully understood but, according to the analysis of different virus genomes, it is believed that MERS-CoV may have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels in the distance past.

The main question is this: If the source has still not been identified then why was this virus named after Middle East. 

The paragraph below, taken from the WHO website talks about MERS and is extremely similar to the series of events which unfolded from January 2020. 

> Cases identified outside the Middle East are people who were infected in the Middle East and travelled to areas outside the Middle East. On rare occasions, small outbreaks have occurred in areas outside the Middle East.

**People infected with Chinese Virus had a travel history to China or came in direct or indirect contact with someone who did.**

There is no denying this statement. In fact, one of the main variables which were being used to track infections in India before the lockdown period was travel history. 

But for *some* reason the WHO decided not to call this virus what it is and gave it the name COVID-19.
